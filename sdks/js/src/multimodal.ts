// These endpoints are the ones the OpenAI-shaped client handles worst, and
// each way it handles them badly costs the caller money:
//
//   - `/audio/speech` and `/videos/{id}/content` return BYTES. Parsing a
//     binary body as JSON yields `{}`, so the call reports success and hands
//     back nothing for a request that was billed.
//   - `/audio/transcriptions` and `/audio/translations` publish FOUR success
//     media types — JSON, plain text, SRT and VTT. Collapsing them to JSON
//     throws away the subtitle track the caller asked for.
//   - Multipart uploads put a caller-supplied filename into a MIME header,
//     and MIME header parameters have no escape for a line break.
//
// Every guard below names the failure it prevents. Nothing here reaches the
// network on its own: the transport is injected (see `Transport`), so all of

//
// Rule #14: the endpoint list is closed and comes from
