"""The client-side retry and timeout policy, observed at the transport.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `nRouter` subclasses the vendor OpenAI client, which
retries twice by default on 408/409/429 and every 5xx. Inheriting that applied
it to `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/images/generations`,
`/v1/audio/speech` and `/v1/videos` — billed, non-idempotent POSTs. Gateway
gate 8: a retry is a second call and a second BILL, the gateway reserves credit
once per customer request and owns retry and failover on its own side.

The tell that the defect was real: every other test file in this suite passes
`max_retries=0` explicitly. The suite was disabling what production shipped
with.

These tests COUNT ATTEMPTS AT THE TRANSPORT. They never assert on a recorded
constructor argument — `max_retries=0` sitting in a kwargs dict proves the value
was stored, not that it reached the retry loop, and the whole point is what goes
out on the wire.
