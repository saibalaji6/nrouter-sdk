# Sub-skill: Testing the nRouter SDKs

Skill `nrouter-sdk`, sub-skill `testing` (merged from the former standalone `nrouter-sdk-testing` skill,
v1.0.0). Open it when adding, changing, running, or auditing tests in any of the ten nRouter SDKs —
the per-language runner commands, the offline-by-default contract, the billed live-probe gate, the
in-process fake transport per ecosystem, and what a new wire must be covered by before it ships.

Ten SDKs on one gateway contract (the list, and how to derive it, is in the router `../SKILL.md`).
This sub-skill is how you run them, what you must cover, and the one invariant that makes the suite
usable in automation.

## THE INVARIANT: the default suite is OFFLINE, and stays that way

**Every default test command in this repo runs with no network, no API key, no gateway and no
database.** That is not an accident and it is not a nice-to-have — it is what lets any SDK's suite
run in a sandbox, in parallel, on a fresh checkout, with nothing provisioned.

The mechanism is one convention, applied identically in all ten SDKs: each ships exactly one
billed acceptance probe, always named `Live*` / `test_live.py` / `test-live.R`, and it is gated on
`NROUTER_LIVE=1` **using that language's native skip primitive** — never an early `return`, which
reports a pass for a test that never ran.

| SDK | how the live probe is gated |
|---|---|
| js | a `skip` const read from `process.env.NROUTER_LIVE` |
| python | `pytest.mark.skipif` module-level `pytestmark` |
| java | `@EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable(named="NROUTER_LIVE", matches="1")` |
| go | `t.Skip(...)` on the env check |
| rust | `#[ignore]` on every test; needs `--ignored` to run at all |
| kotlin | `@EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable` |
| android | `assumeTrue(...)` — JUnit reports skipped, never failed |
| swift | `throw XCTSkip(...)` |
| dart | the `test(..., skip: ...)` argument |
| r | `skip_if(...)` |

**Adding a test that needs a key, a socket or a gateway to PASS breaks this property.** If you need
one, it belongs behind the same `NROUTER_LIVE` gate, with the same native skip. Verify your gate by
running the suite with the variable unset and confirming your test reports **skipped**, not passed.

⚠️ **A live probe spends real credit against a real key.** Never wire one into a default command, a
CI job, or a pre-commit path.

## Runner commands — derive from the manifest, these are the entry points

Run from the SDK's own directory unless noted.

| SDK | command | tests live in |
|---|---|---|
| js | `npm test` (builds first, then the smoke + package-entry entrypoints) | `test/*.test.ts` |
| python | `pip install -e ".[dev]"` then `pytest` | `tests/test_*.py` |
| java | `mvn test` | `src/test/java/ai/nrouter/sdk/` |
| go | `go test ./...` | `*_test.go` beside source |
| rust | `cargo test` | `tests/*.rs` + inline `#[cfg(test)]` |
| kotlin | `./gradlew test` | `src/test/kotlin/ai/nrouter/sdk/` |
| android | `./gradlew test` (JVM unit tests, Robolectric-backed) | `src/test/kotlin/ai/nrouter/sdk/android/` |
| swift | `swift test` — **run in BOTH the repo root and `sdks/swift/`**, two manifests ship the same target | `Tests/NRouterTests/` |
| dart | `dart pub get && dart test` | `test/*_test.dart` |
| r | `R CMD build r && R CMD check nrouter_*.tar.gz --as-cran --no-manual`, from `sdks/` | `tests/testthat/` |

⚠️ **R: a green `test_dir()` or `devtools::test()` is NOT the signal.** `R CMD check` installs the
package first and then runs the suite; only that path exercises what a user gets.

⚠️ **JS: `npm test` builds first.** A stale `dist/` is a real source of "passes locally, fails in
CI" — never run the test entrypoints directly and call it green.

## The conformance gate — the only cross-SDK check, and it needs nothing

What the gate enforces, how to run it (`--self-test` first), why it needs only Python 3, and what
it deliberately does NOT catch are stated once in the router (`../SKILL.md`, "Shared facts → The
conformance gate"). The short version for a test author: it proves a spec constant is *referenced*,
never that it is used *correctly*, so it never stands in for a test in the SDK's own suite.

## Fakes: ecosystem-native and in-process, never a shared library

There is no cross-language fixture layer, on purpose — each SDK uses what its ecosystem already
has, so a contributor reads one familiar idiom instead of a bespoke one.

`js` stubs `globalThis.fetch` · `python` uses `httpx.MockTransport` (plus a threaded local server
for media) · `java` uses `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer`, **not** MockWebServer · `go` uses
`httptest.NewServer` · `kotlin`/`android` use OkHttp `mockwebserver` · `swift` intercepts
`URLProtocol` · `dart` uses `MockClient` · `r` uses `webfakes` · `rust` asserts against source-level
constants.

All of these bind to loopback or intercept in-process. **None reaches the network, and none may
start to.**

⚠️ **R's `webfakes` is a `Suggests`, not an `Imports`.** Every test using it must self-guard with
`skip_if_not_installed("webfakes")` **and** the availability probe — a machine without the package
skips cleanly rather than failing.

## What a change must be covered by

**A new wire or route** — the native helper on every SDK that owns it (or a declared delegation
seam), plus a contract test asserting method, path and headers, plus the conformance route cell.

**An error-mapping change** — a test per affected status code proving the mapped class, in the
SDKs that map it. Conformance sees only that the code exists somewhere.

**A header change** — assert the header is SENT or PARSED into the right field. Conformance only
proves the string appears.

**A timeout, retry or cancellation change** — a behavioural test with a fake that actually delays,
aborts or fails. **A client-side retry double-bills a customer** (router, "Shared facts → The client
retries nothing on a billed path"), so any change there — above all in the two vendor-client-based
SDKs — needs a test proving the zero-retry pin holds.

**Never** test generated code, a vendor client's internals, or formatting.

## Density beats file count

Four SDKs carry only two test files each — one large `Contract*` suite of 44–49 test functions, plus
the live probe. That is not thin coverage, and "add more files" is not the fix. Judge a suite by
which behaviours it pins, and prove a new test bites by breaking the code on purpose and watching
it go red before you trust it.

## Publishing reality — three of ten

Only `js` (npm, OIDC trusted publishing), `python` (PyPI) and `java` (Maven Central, GPG-signed)
reach an immutable public registry. The rest build, test and verify in CI without uploading: Go and
Swift resolve from git tags, R indexes automatically, and Kotlin, Android, Rust and Dart are
verify-only. **A registry publish is irreversible** — the version gates that refuse an already
published version exist for that reason and are never to be worked around.
