// TYPE-ONLY, and the only import in this file. `AbortSignalLike` is declared in
// `multimodal.ts` (structural, because this package compiles with no DOM lib,
// so naming `AbortSignal` would make the SDK depend on the caller's ambient
// type environment). Re-declaring it here would give the SDK two cancellation
// types that happen to match today — exactly the drift this module exists to
// prevent. A `import type` is erased at compile time, so there is no cycle.
