SDK for the [nRouter](https://nrouter.ai) LLM gateway: one API key for models
across six provider clouds. It wraps the official `openai` package with the
same API surface, pre-configured for nRouter.

The examples below pass a `claude-*` id on purpose: `client.nr.chat()` sends
Claude ids to `/v1/messages` itself (the only wire Anthropic serves) and
translates the response back to an OpenAI-shaped completion. The plain
`client.chat.completions.create()` surface does **not** do that — give it a
model whose provider serves chat-completions, such as `gpt-5.4-mini`. Pass any
model returned by `client.nrouterModels.list()` for your key.

## Install

```bash
npm install @nrouter_ai/sdk
```

## Authentication & Setup

The SDK automatically reads your API key from the `NROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export NROUTER_API_KEY="sk-nrouter-your-api-key-here"
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { nRouter } from "@nrouter_ai/sdk";

const client = new nRouter(); // reads NROUTER_API_KEY from env

const response = await client.nr.chat({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  prompt: "Hello!",
  maxTokens: 32,
});
console.log(client.nr.text(response));
```

```javascript
const { nRouter } = require("@nrouter_ai/sdk");

const client = new nRouter({ apiKey: process.env.NROUTER_API_KEY });
```

`nRouter` extends the `OpenAI` class directly, so the resources nRouter serves
(`chat.completions`, `completions`, `responses`, `embeddings`, `images`, `audio`,
`videos`, `models`, streaming) are called exactly as you would call them against
OpenAI — same method names, same request and response shapes.

### What "compatible" does and does not mean

The `openai` package exposes a larger API than nRouter serves, and a model is
callable only on the routes ITS provider serves. Three limits. Every one of them
fails loudly — a 404 from the gateway, never a silent wrong answer — but they
fail at call time, not at compile time: the wrapper inherits the full `openai`
type surface, so all three type-check.

- **Resources nRouter does not mount.** The served resources are exactly
  `chat.completions`, `completions`, `responses`, `embeddings`, `images`,
  `audio`, `videos` and `models`. Everything else the `openai` client carries
  404s — `files`, `fineTuning`, `batches`, `beta` (assistants/threads),
  `vectorStores`, `uploads`, `containers`, `conversations`, `webhooks`,
  `moderations`, `evals`, `graders`, `admin`, `skills` and
  `contentProvenanceChecks`. `realtime` is the one that does not 404, because it
  is a WebSocket surface with no gateway to connect to; it fails to open. Treat
  the served list, not this one, as authoritative — it is
  `spec/nrouter-sdk-spec.json`, derived from the gateway's own route table.
- **Methods a served resource does not mount.** Being on the served list is per
  ROUTE, not per resource. `images.generate()` is served and `images.edit()` /
  `images.createVariation()` are not; `videos.create()`, `videos.retrieve()` and
  `videos.downloadContent()` are served and `videos.list()` / `videos.delete()` /
  `videos.remix()` are not; `models.list()` and `models.retrieve()` are served
  and `models.delete()` is not.
- **Routes a model's provider does not serve.** An Anthropic model answers
  `/v1/messages` and neither `/v1/chat/completions` nor `/v1/responses`. Only
  OpenAI and Azure models answer `/v1/responses`. Sending a Claude id to
  `client.chat.completions.create()` is a 404 from the gateway, not a
  translation. **AWS Bedrock is narrower than its name suggests: only the
  Anthropic family on Bedrock is served, and only on `/v1/messages`.** A Nova,
  Llama, Titan, Qwen, Mistral or DeepSeek id on Bedrock has no text route here
  at all — the refusal says so rather than pointing you at a second wire.

`client.nr.chat()` covers the common half of the third one: it recognises a
Claude id by name and sends it to `/v1/messages`. That is a NAME heuristic, so
it does not help with an alias whose name hides its provider — a Bedrock or
Vertex id for a non-Claude model. For those, and whenever you call
`client.chat.completions` directly, ask the gateway instead of guessing:

```typescript
const models = await client.nrouterModels.list();
const entry = models.data.find((m) => m.id === alias);
// e.g. ["/v1/messages", "/v1/messages/count_tokens"]
console.log(entry.nrouter_endpoints);
```

Any alias whose `nrouter_endpoints` contains `/v1/chat/completions` works with
the stock `openai` resource unmodified. An empty array means no route on this
gateway serves that alias — pick another model rather than trying a second wire.

## nRouter Helpers

Use `client.nr.chat()` when you want nRouter features and response metadata in
one call:

```typescript
const result = await client.nr.chat({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  prompt: "Summarize this ticket.",
  systemPrompt: "Be concise.",
  promptTemplateId: "<prompt-template-id>",
  promptVariables: { customer: "Acme" },
  cache: false, // force provider egress; omit or true uses the gateway default
});

console.log(client.nr.text(result));
console.log(result.meta.requestId, result.meta.cost, result.meta.model);
```

Guardrails are **not** selected per request. They are assigned per key, team or
organization in the nRouter dashboard and apply automatically to every call.
The `guardrailIds` option is deprecated and throws a configuration error: the
gateway runs no per-request override, so it never scoped anything.

Other helpers:

- `client.nr.compare(options, models)` runs one prompt against several models
  and returns results in the same order as `models`.
- `client.nr.stream(options, signal)` opens an SSE stream with typed errors.
- `client.nr.responses(body, options)` posts to `/v1/responses` and applies the
  same nRouter guardrail, prompt-template and cache fields.
- `client.nr.messages(body, options)` posts to `/v1/messages` for Anthropic-style
  message bodies while keeping nRouter metadata and errors.
- `client.nr.countTokens(body)` posts to `/v1/messages/count_tokens`; the body is
  sent unchanged so callers can use the gateway token-count contract directly.
- `client.nr.meta(headers)` parses `x-nr-*` headers from a response you obtained
  another way.
- `client.nr.media.speech()`, `.transcribe()`, `.translate()`, `.image()`,
  `.video()`, `.videoStatus()`, `.videoContent()` and `.embeddings()` cover the
  non-chat endpoints with the same metadata and error handling.

## Audio and voice

`speech()` returns audio BYTES with the metadata attached, and `transcribe()` /
`translate()` return a result discriminated on the media type you asked for, so
an `srt` request comes back as a cue track rather than flattened into `{ text }`:

```typescript
const spoken = await client.nr.media.speech({
  model: "tts-1",
  input: "The build is green.",
  voice: "alloy",
  response_format: "mp3",
});
await fs.writeFile("out.mp3", spoken.bytes);

const heard = await client.nr.media.transcribe({
  file: spoken.bytes,
  fileName: "out.mp3",              // the extension is required
  model: "gpt-4o-mini-transcribe",
  response_format: "verbose_json",  // see below — this is a billing decision
});
```

`response_format` is not only a formatting choice. A `whisper-1` transcription is
priced from the response's `duration`, and `duration` arrives **only** with
`verbose_json` — ask for anything else on a per-second model and the call is
served but settles unpriced, with no cost figure to report. Token-priced models
(`gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`, `gpt-4o-transcribe`) are unaffected. Speech is priced
per character of `input`.

There is no streaming TTS and no realtime session: a voice turn is a cascade of
three separately billed calls, `transcribe()` → `nr.chat()` → `speech()`. The
runnable version is [`demo/voice-agent/`](demo/voice-agent/),
and the full semantics — the upload rules, what is and is not guardrail-scanned,
and why a missing cost must never be summed as zero — are in
[docs/audio.md](./docs/audio.md).

## Images

`image()` always returns JSON — `url` gives you links and `b64_json` gives you
base64 inside the body, and there is no image-bytes route to return instead:

```typescript
const res = await client.nr.media.image({
  model: "gpt-image-1-mini",
  prompt: "A flat vector lighthouse at dusk, three colours, no text.",
  n: 1,                     // 1 through 10 — each image is a separate charge
  size: "1024x1024",
  quality: "low",
});
```

`n`, `size`, `quality` and `response_format` are checked before the request leaves
the process, against the gateway's own bounds, so a typo costs no round trip;
`validateImageParams()` is exported so a form can use the same check. Pass an
unlisted value through `extra` if a model takes one.

Which quantity you are billed on depends on the model — `gpt-image-*` prices from
the `usage` block in the body, everything else prices per image from `n` × size ×
quality — and **no response header carries the count, size or quality**. Reconcile
against the spend row by request id rather than recomputing. The runnable version
is [`demo/image-agent/`](demo/image-agent/)
and the semantics are in [docs/images.md](./docs/images.md).

## Video

Video is asynchronous: the create returns a job, and you collect the result over
two more calls. **Only the create bills.**

```typescript
const created = await client.nr.media.video({
  model: "sora-2",
  prompt: "A lighthouse beam sweeping over water at dusk.",
  seconds: 4,
  size: "1280x720",
});

const jobId = String(created.body.id);
await client.nr.media.waitForVideo(jobId, { pollIntervalMs: 5000, timeoutMs: 600_000 });
const file = await client.nr.media.videoContent(jobId);
await fs.writeFile("out.mp4", file.bytes);
```

Polling and downloading are free of credit but not free of quota — every poll
spends a rate-limit slot, which is why `pollIntervalMs` has a floor. A free call
reports `costStatus: null`, which is **not** the same as the `unpriced` a billed
call reports when it could not be priced; conflating them turns a long render into
a pricing bug that does not exist. A retry of the create is a second *render*, not
merely a second bill. The runnable version is
[`demo/video-agent/`](demo/video-agent/) and
the semantics — the sealed job handle, why an accepted-then-failed job stays
billed, and the download bound — are in [docs/video.md](./docs/video.md).

## Model Discovery

Use the nRouter helper for model listing:

```typescript
const models = await client.nrouterModels.list();
console.log(models.data[0].id);
```

The raw nRouter `/models` response is valid JSON, but the current OpenAI JS SDK
page parser exposes it with an empty `data` array. `nrouterModels.list()`
bypasses that parser and returns the gateway response directly. It still travels
the client's own request pipeline, so a configured `fetch`, `timeout`,
`maxRetries`, `fetchOptions` and default headers apply to it exactly as they do
to every other call.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm test
```

The test suite runs TypeScript test files directly through Node's built-in test
runner, so use Node `22.18.0` or newer. Older Node 22 builds fail before the
tests execute because they cannot strip TypeScript syntax from `.ts` test files.

## Examples And Live Diagnostics

The repo includes JavaScript examples and interactive tools for manual SDK checks:

```bash
npm run build
node demo/agent.js --live
node demo/interactive-agent.mjs --live --voice
node demo/ui/server.js
```

`demo/interactive-agent.mjs` provides an interactive terminal REPL with multi-turn chat, streaming tokens, model switching, per-turn latency/cost tracking, and optional speech synthesis playback (`--voice`).

`demo/ui/server.js` starts a conversational browser UI at `http://127.0.0.1:4317` with real-time SSE streaming, speech recognition via browser microphone, audio replay for voice synthesis, and one-click test suite execution. The browser does not receive the API key; the local Node server reads `NROUTER_API_KEY` and calls the built SDK package.

See [`demo/README.md`](demo/README.md) for commands and
[`docs/live-sdk-agent-report.md`](./docs/live-sdk-agent-report.md) for the latest
manual test findings.

## Requirements

**Node 22.18 or newer**, declared in `engines`. That is the floor for this
package because the test runner executes TypeScript tests directly through
Node's native type stripping. Before 2.0.0 nothing declared a floor at all, so
an unsupported runtime failed somewhere further in with a worse message.

The dependency tree is deliberately **one package**. `openai` 7 has no
dependencies of its own, where `openai` 4 pulled in 36 transitive packages —
which is where every supply-chain advisory against this package used to come
from.

## How guardrails, budgets and routing work

They are configured in the dashboard and enforced at the **gateway**, not in
this package. The useful guarantee is not that they are always on — it is that
**whatever you have enabled cannot be bypassed by a client**, this one
included, and behaves identically from every nRouter SDK and from raw `curl`.

- [Guardrails](https://nrouter.ai/docs/guides/guardrails) — PII redaction,
  injection protection, secret and keyword scanning, pre-call and post-call.
  Which ones run is resolved per request: the organization's guardrail switch
  first, then the narrowest applicable assignment wins across
  key > team > org > default, and a winner disabled at that scope does not run.
- [Budget controls](https://nrouter.ai/docs/guides/budget-controls) — spend
  limits per key, team and organization.
- [Observability](https://nrouter.ai/docs/guides/observability) — cost and usage
  on billable calls. Free routes are genuinely free and carry no
  `x-nr-request-cost`: `/v1/messages/count_tokens`, and video polling and
  content retrieval.

[Smart Router aliases and fallback chains](https://nrouter.ai/docs/guides/router-settings)
carry two conditions worth knowing before you rely on failover you have not
enabled:

- **Opt-in by what you put in `model`.** An alias gets the strategy and its
  chain; a concrete model is never re-routed and inherits no hidden fallback.
- **Text wires only** — chat completions, responses, messages and legacy
  completions. Audio, image and video calls take a single-provider route and
  are not cross-provider Smart Router wires.
- [Node.js / TypeScript quickstart](https://nrouter.ai/docs/sdks/nodejs) and the
  [API reference](https://nrouter.ai/docs/api-reference).
