# Routing and fallbacks

Routing is **opt-in through the `model` you send**, and nothing else. There is no
routing option in this SDK, and adding one would not help: the decision is made
from your organization's configuration, keyed on the model name in the request.

```ts
await client.nr.chat({ model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929', prompt });  // concrete
await client.nr.chat({ model: 'summariser', prompt });                            // an alias you configured
```

- **A concrete model id is never re-routed.** It resolves to one deployment, it
  is called, and it inherits no hidden fallback. If that provider is down, the
  call fails.
- **An alias you configured** resolves to an ordered chain of deployments plus a
  strategy. The gateway walks the chain.

A model name that matches no configured alias simply has an empty chain, which is
the concrete-model case again: one deployment, one attempt. Most organizations
configure no chains at all, and that is a supported steady state, not a
misconfiguration.

## What the chain gives you

Each chain entry names a provider and an upstream model. The strategy decides the
order the entries are tried in:

| Strategy | Order |
|---|---|
| `priority` | the configured order; the default, and what the gateway falls back to |
| `cost` | cheapest first |
| `latency` | fastest observed first |
| `weighted` | proportional split |
| `pinned` | an exact deployment was named; no selection happens |

Entries whose circuit breaker is open are skipped. Health state is advanced when
an attempt fails, so a provider having a bad minute drops out of the rotation
without you doing anything.

If the health data cannot be read, routing degrades to "walk the chain in order"
rather than failing your request.

## Which failures actually fail over — this is narrower than you expect

Only **429 and 503** (and the Anthropic-family `529`) advance to the next chain
entry. They are the two statuses that mean *the provider refused before doing any
work*.

Everything else is fatal to the walk:

| Status | Behaviour | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `429`, `503`, `529` | try the next entry | nothing was generated and nothing was billed |
| `500`, `502`, `504` | fail | the provider may have generated **and billed** a completion we never delivered; a retry buys a second one you never see |
| `4xx` other than 429 | fail | a second provider rejects a malformed request too, and you have then paid twice for nothing |

Transport failures are narrower still: only a failure during **connect** is
retried. Once the connection was established we cannot tell whether a completion
was generated, and an "unbillable-looking" retry is how one request becomes two
bills.

## One request, one reservation, one rate-limit slot

The credit reservation and the rate-limit slot are taken **once per request**,
above the walk — not once per attempt. Three attempts hold one reservation and
consume one slot. So a failover cannot double-charge you, and a chain walk during
an outage cannot drain your own rate limit.

## Where cross-provider failover is available, and where it provably is not

| Wire | Cross-provider failover |
|---|---|
| `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/messages` | yes — each attempt is prepared for the deployment it targets |
| images, video, audio | no — the credential is prepared once for the whole walk |

On the media wires the provider credential is minted before the walk begins, so a
chain entry naming a **different provider or a different upstream model** is
*refused* rather than called: sending one provider's key to another is a
credential leak wearing a failover's clothes. Those entries are skipped exactly
as an entry with no credential would be.

The practical consequence: configuring a cross-provider fallback chain for an
image or audio alias will not give you failover. Chain entries that stay on the
same provider and the same upstream model still work there.

### On the text wires, an entry whose provider does not serve THAT ROUTE is skipped

The `yes` above is about the mechanism, and read alone it is misleading. Failover
being available on a wire does not mean every chain entry can be tried on it: a
provider serves the routes it declares a path for, and **an entry on a provider
that declares no path for the route you called is skipped, exactly like an entry
with no credential.** Nothing is sent, nothing is billed, and the walk moves on.

That is per-entry, not per-route, so a route-level yes/no cannot express it:

| Route | Providers that serve it |
|---|---|
| `/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Foundry, Vertex AI, Alibaba DashScope |
| `/v1/responses` | OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Foundry |
| `/v1/messages` | Anthropic, Vertex AI, AWS Bedrock (Anthropic-family models only) |
| `/v1/completions` | OpenAI |
| `/v1/messages/count_tokens` | **Anthropic only** |
| `/v1/embeddings` | **OpenAI only** |
| `/v1/images/generations` | **OpenAI only** |
| `/v1/audio/speech` | **OpenAI only** |
| `/v1/audio/transcriptions` | **OpenAI only** |
| `/v1/audio/translations` | **OpenAI only** |
| `/v1/videos` | **OpenAI only** |
| `/v1/videos/{id}` · `/v1/videos/{id}/content` | **OpenAI only** (same capability as generation) |
| `/v1/models` · `/v1/models/{model_id}` | listing surface — no provider constraint |

### Nine of the eleven non-text routes are single-provider, and that is an ALLOWLIST

Three of the four text rows above list several providers each, which makes the
table look like a general "most providers serve most routes" story. It is not.
The fourth text row, `/v1/completions`, is OpenAI alone — the legacy completions
wire has no cross-provider failover either, so a chain for it can only hold
other OpenAI deployments. And every non-text route that *calls a provider* is
served by **exactly one** provider family. The two exceptions are the listing
routes `/v1/models` and `/v1/models/{model_id}`, which call no provider at all
and carry no constraint — they return the catalogue your key can see:

* **`count_tokens` — Anthropic alone.** It is Anthropic's own token counter; no
  other upstream exposes an equivalent at a path this gateway mounts.
* **embeddings, images, all three audio routes and all three video routes —
  OpenAI alone** (the `openai` and `codex` provider ids, which are the same
  upstream).

This is an allowlist, not a gap that quietly widens: a newly registered provider
serves none of these routes until its upstream path, request shape, response
shape, usage, pricing and credential handling have each been added and tested.

**What that means for a fallback chain.** The per-entry skip rule above applies
here with far more bite: a chain entry for an image, audio, video or embeddings
call on any provider other than OpenAI is skipped, so a chain built entirely from
Anthropic, Bedrock, Vertex or DashScope entries has every entry skipped and the
request fails while the chain looks configured. There is no cross-provider
failover available on those routes today — a fallback there can only be another
OpenAI deployment.

**The case that bites is `/v1/responses`.** Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Vertex AI and
Alibaba DashScope declare no Responses path, so a Responses chain whose entries
are all on those providers has every entry skipped and the request fails — the
chain looks configured and failover never happens. Same shape one route over:
Anthropic and Bedrock declare no chat-completions path, so they cannot be
failover targets for `/v1/chat/completions` either.

**AWS Bedrock is narrower than the table row alone reads**, and it is the one
place where the answer is per MODEL rather than per provider. Bedrock declares
`/v1/messages` and serves only the Anthropic family there; every other family
takes a different upstream request schema. So a Bedrock entry for a Nova, Llama,
Titan, Qwen, Mistral or DeepSeek model serves **no** text route at all and can
never be a failover target on any of the four wires. Its `nrouter_endpoints` is
empty, which is the honest answer and the one to build chains from.

**Do not infer a model's route from its name.** Ask the gateway. Every entry in
`GET /v1/models` carries the routes that alias actually answers on:

```ts
const models = await client.nrouterModels.list();
const entry = models.data.find((m) => m.id === alias);
entry.nrouter_endpoints; // e.g. ["/v1/messages", "/v1/messages/count_tokens"]
```

Build a chain out of entries whose `nrouter_endpoints` all contain the route you
intend to call, and the walk has somewhere to go on every hop.

## What the response tells you

`res.meta.model` is the model that **actually served** the request, which is not
always the alias you sent. Log it. On a chain walk it is the only thing in the
response that says which deployment answered.
