#: a default imports this name.
#:
#: It MUST be a model the gateway serves on `/v1/chat/completions`, because that
#: is the only wire `_nRouterChat.chat()` posts to — there is no per-model wire
#: switch here. The gateway resolves a provider endpoint PER WIRE and answers
#: 404 `model_unavailable_on_route` when the provider declares none, so an
#: Anthropic id (Messages-only) was a 404 out of the box for anyone who called
#: `client.nrouter.chat(messages)` without naming a model. `gpt-5.4-mini` is the
#: Rule #14 source-of-truth default and is served on this wire. Pinned by
#: `tests/test_defaults.py` and by `conformance/source_defaults.py`.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Transport defaults
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: Automatic client-side retries. ZERO, deliberately.
#:
#: NO CLIENT-SIDE RETRY ON A BILLED POST. The vendor client defaults to TWO
#: automatic retries on 408, 409, 429 and every 5xx, and subclassing it without
#: saying otherwise inherited that default onto `/v1/chat/completions`,
#: `/v1/responses`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/images/generations`,
#: `/v1/audio/speech`, `/v1/audio/transcriptions` and `/v1/videos` — none of
#: which are idempotent. Gateway gate 8 is explicit that a retry is a SECOND
#: CALL and a SECOND BILL: the gateway reserves credit exactly once per customer
#: request and owns retry and failover on its own side, above the provider and
#: below that reservation, so a client retrying on top of it pays twice for one
#: answer and the gateway has nothing to dedupe the second call against.
#:
#: The dangerous case is the timeout or the 5xx, not the honest refusal. The
#: gateway may have accepted, dispatched and billed the request before the
#: socket died, so the attempt that "failed" is a completed purchase and the
#: retry buys another one. A 400 is safe and is not retried by anyone.
#:
#: OVERRIDABLE: `nRouter(max_retries=3)` is honoured exactly as passed.
#:
#: NOT PER-METHOD, and that is a loss taken knowingly. The JS SDK forces 0 only
#: on the billed non-GET paths and leaves GET on the caller's setting, because
#: the vendor JS client accepts `maxRetries` as a PER-REQUEST option. The Python
#: vendor client does not expose one: no resource method takes `max_retries`
#: (measured — `chat.completions.create` and friends surface only
#: `extra_headers`, `extra_query`, `extra_body` and `timeout`), and the two
#: public levers, the constructor and `client.with_options(max_retries=n)`, are
#: both per-CLIENT and method-blind. Splitting by method would mean overriding
#: the private `request()` on the hot path of both the sync and the async
#: client, and the failure mode of that after an upstream signature change is
#: SILENT: `super()` is still called, unchanged, and billed POSTs quietly get
#: vendor retries back. A silent money defect is worse than the loss below.
#:
#: WHAT WAS GIVEN UP: the two inherited GETs, `models.list()` and
#: `models.retrieve()`, no longer retry a transient 5xx by themselves. Nothing
#: else changes, and the SDK gets MORE consistent rather than less — the
#: nRouter-native helpers (`nrouter_models.list()`, `messages`, `videos`) go
#: straight through `self._client`, a plain httpx client that has never had
#: retries at all, so every GET here now behaves one way instead of two. A
#: caller who wants it back asks per call, on the vendor's own public API, and
#: arms no POST doing so::
#:
#:     client.with_options(max_retries=2).models.list()
DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES = 0

#: Per-attempt timeout: 600 s in total, 10 s to connect.
#:
#: EXPLICIT rather than inherited. The vendor's own default happens to be 600 s
#: with a 5 s connect today, but this number is load-bearing here in a way it is
#: not there: with retries off (above) a timeout is FINAL, so it has to be
#: generous enough for the slowest thing the gateway legitimately does rather
#: than for the typical one. 600 s covers a long reasoning completion, a
#: full-length speech synthesis and a large image or transcription response. The
#: video routes never need it — `videos.create` returns a job id and the render
#: is polled — so nothing here waits on a generation to finish.
#:
#: The connect leg is 10 s rather than 5 s for the same reason: a cold TLS
#: handshake on a slow corporate or CI network is no longer retried away, and
#: 10 s still fails fast against a genuinely unreachable host.
#:
#: OVERRIDABLE, and it does not steal a custom transport's own setting — see
#: `_apply_transport_defaults`.
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = httpx.Timeout(600.0, connect=10.0)

#: httpx's own default, which the vendor uses as a STRUCTURAL sentinel for "this
#: custom http_client was never given a timeout". Constructed rather than
#: imported because upstream it is the private `httpx2._config`
#: `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_CONFIG`; measured equal to it on httpx2 2.12.0.

    THE ENVELOPE. Measured against a live gateway on 2026-08-25, every gateway

        {"error": {"type": "gateway_error", "message": "unknown model: gpt-9"}}

    Two things follow, and the pre-2.1.0 client got both wrong. There is no
    top-level ``code`` key, and the top-level ``error`` is an OBJECT, not a
    string. That client read ``body["code"]`` (always absent, so no branch ever
    matched) and ``body["error"]`` as the message (a dict, so a customer's log
    would have received a stringified mapping). It also read ``type``, which is
    the constant ``"gateway_error"`` on every single error and therefore
    classifies nothing.

    Classification is by STATUS plus the message, because status is what the
    gateway actually varies. The two 400s are separated on the message because
    that is the only signal present: a guardrail block and a malformed body
    share a status code.

    Returning ``None`` leaves the original ``APIStatusError`` to propagate,

    THE MESSAGES WIRE IS THE ONLY ROUTE TO A MANAGED PROMPT FOR CLAUDE. The
    gateway resolves a provider endpoint per WIRE and answers 404
    `model_unavailable_on_route` for an Anthropic-family model on
    `/v1/chat/completions` (see `DEFAULT_MODEL` above and `tests/test_defaults.py`),
    and `_nRouterChat.chat()` posts only to chat-completions. So the named
    prompt options that path already had were unreachable for exactly the
    provider family this endpoint exists to serve; a Claude caller had to type
    the wire field names into `**kwargs` themselves.

    That also meant `**kwargs` was an UNVETTED body hatch on the one path they
    could use. `vet_extra` refuses two shapes here, both broken rather than
    merely unmodelled — a tenancy key (gateway §4f gate 5: tenancy comes from
    the authenticated virtual key alone, and a body-supplied identifier
    attributes no spend while reaching the provider as an unrecognized
    argument) and `__proto__`. Refused, never stripped: stripping leaves the
    caller believing they attributed spend somewhere, and that belief is wrong
    forever and silently. Everything else still passes straight through, which
    is what keeps an option this SDK does not model yet from being a blocker.

    Ordering mirrors the JS SDK's `buildFeatureBody`
    (`{...body, ...buildExtraBody(opts)}`, `sdks/js/src/client.ts` ->
    `sdks/js/src/options.ts`): the named option wins over a raw kwarg of the
    same wire name, so the two SDKs resolve that collision identically.

    `build_extra_body` is the ONE mapper to the spec's `extra_body_fields`
    (Rule #14) and OMITS what the caller did not set — omission and emptiness
    mean different things on this wire.

        `_make_status_error` is the correct seam rather than an httpx event

        a permanent 402 look like a transient network failure to any caller
        branching on the type.

        The retry argument that used to be the whole of this note still holds

        attempt and defeat the retry the caller explicitly asked for. Under the
